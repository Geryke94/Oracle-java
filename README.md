# Oracle-java
A repo intended for the tutorials offered by Oracle. Many thanks and All rights reserved.

Everybody knows the great potential that already existing trainings can hold for us.
I had the idea about a challenge to go through all the available tutorials that The Really Big Index of Oracle contains.
This would be a great opportunity to develop myself and maybe to serve as guideline to others.
