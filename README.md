# Oracle-java
A repo intended for the tutorials offered by Oracle. Many thanks and All rights reserved.

Everybody knows the great potential that already existing trainings can hold for us.
I had the idea about a challenge to go through all the available tutorials that The Really Big Index of Oracle contains.
This would be a great opportunity to develop myself and maybe to serve as guideline to others.

The whole initiative will be split into multiple projects, named Trails by the Oracle guide.
Each Trail includes related lessons to a specific topic, so the content will be clear and organized. 

## Getting Started
This Trail is only a high overview and introduction about Java programming language.

###  HelloWorldApp
This app prints out a specified string to stdout.

## Learning the Java Language
